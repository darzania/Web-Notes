### Tips

I will try out the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), I can launch it using the `node` command in the terminal.

Working on my code iteratively (in small pieces) â€“ is the way to go.

To see how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` in my function, I'll run this in the Terminal.


```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
